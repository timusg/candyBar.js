#CandyBar

Self-contained, self-rendering, call status UI bar for phone web apps.

- no dependencies
- includes structural css and some basic styles (meant to be overridden)
- not designed to be an authority on call state, rather, to be a reactive view for actual call state


## Demo
To see a demo, clone it and open demo.html in a browser and click the various buttons.

##Gotchas

 - Still needs a bit more work/polish/testing.
 - Requires new-ish browsers (IE8+)
